# Doodle brain

(WIP)

The main brain module or high level module of Doodle

This modules is able of create the low level circuits of the robots in and upload them to the FPGA in real time.

The brain can be excuted in a Raspberry pi 2 or 3 with apio installed.

Actually **is NOT compatible** with Raspberry zero due to Apio and an incompatibility between architectures.

## To correctly test this program you will need:

* Python 3

* Apio:

  ``` bash
  sudo pip3 install apio
  ```

* Empy:

 ``` bash
 sudo pip3 install empy
 ```
* Python 3 tk:

  ``` bash
  sudo apt-get install python3-tk
  ```
